CruX UCLA Wiki based off of Obsidian Zola (https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola)

## To CruX members who wish to add to this wiki
* The notes essentially convert Obsidian .md files into a website format.
* Obsidian is a markdown-based note taking software that is primarily used for its linking ability and various plugins
* If you don't want to learn Obsidian, just write as if everything were markdown and link pages together as so:
  * Surround pairs of brackets around the name of the file you'd like to link to
  * (e.g. to add a link to A.md from B.md, write \[\[A\]\] in B.md)
