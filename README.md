	1. The notes essentially convert Obsidian .md files into a website format.
	2. Obsidian is a markdown-based note taking software that is primarily used for its linking ability and various plugins
	3. If you don't want to learn Obsidian, just write as if everything were markdown and link pages together as so:
		1. Surround pairs of brackets around the name of the file you'd like to link to
		2. (e.g. to add a link to A.md from B.md, write \[\[A\]\] in B.md)
3. Commit to main
4. Wait a couple seconds for the website to finish building
